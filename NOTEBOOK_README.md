# Comprehensive Self-Contained Sentiment Analysis Notebook

## Overview

This notebook (`Comprehensive_Self_Contained_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`) provides a complete, self-contained implementation of a sentiment analysis pipeline that includes all 43 Python files from the repository as executable code chunks. It runs in isolation, requiring only CSV data download, and includes comprehensive documentation, literature review, and development process explanations.
