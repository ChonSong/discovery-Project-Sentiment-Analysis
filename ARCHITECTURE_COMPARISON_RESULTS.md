## Theoretical vs Actual Performance

### Expected vs Actual Results

**Binary Sentiment (3-class in our case):**
- **RNN Variants**: Expected 70-80%, Achieved ~56% (lower due to 3-class complexity)
- **LSTM Variants**: Expected 80-88%, Achieved ~56% (dataset size limitation)
- **GRU Variants**: Expected 80-87%, Achieved 57% (best performer)
- **Transformer Variants**: Expected 88-95%, Achieved 35-43% (insufficient data/training)

### Performance Analysis

1. **Dataset Size Impact**: 800 samples is relatively small for deep learning, especially transformers
2. **Class Imbalance**: Positive class dominance (451/800) affected model performance
3. **Training Duration**: Limited epochs (5) prevented full convergence
4. **Computational Complexity**: More complex models didn't necessarily perform better
